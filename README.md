# Investigating_a_dataset

This dataset is an overview of patients that showed up for their appointments vs those who didnt. 

It checks the age of the patients, their admission status: Scholarship or NoScholarship, the ailment type, and area of residents of those that showed up 
vs those who were absentees and those who showed up at a later date other than the initial appointment date.
